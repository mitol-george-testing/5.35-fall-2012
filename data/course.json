  "course_title": "Introduction to Experimental Chemistry",
  "course_description": "This course is the first part of a modular sequence of increasingly sophisticated (and challenging) laboratory courses required of all Chemistry majors: 5.35 Introduction to Experimental Chemistry, 5.36\u00a0Biochemistry and Organic Laboratory, 5.37\u00a0Organic and Inorganic Laboratory, and 5.38\u00a0Physical Chemistry Laboratory. This course provides students with a survey of spectroscopy, and introduces synthesis of coordination compounds and kinetics.\n\nThis class is part of the new laboratory curriculum in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Undergraduate Research-Inspired Experimental Chemistry Alternatives ([URIECA](http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/www/academic/urieca.html)) introduces students to cutting edge research topics in a modular format.\n\n##### Acknowledgements\n\nProfessor Nelson and Dr. Twardowski would like to acknowledge the contributions of MIT Professor Timothy Swager to the development of this course. Module 3 on Fabrication of a Polymeric Light Emitting Device, taught by Timothy Swager, is not currently available on OCW.\n",
